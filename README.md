# Python and Tarantool Benchmark and Bootstrap

This is demo solution for my article on GitBook [Python Tarantool Benchmark](https://valentinmk.gitbooks.io/python-tarantool-benchmark/).

The goal of the solution is benchmark Tarantool and Python async web servers performance.

The second purpose is to show how you can write solution with Tarantool and aiohttp, sanic and japronto libraries.

You can install the solution on your own server by reproducing bash commands described in [install.md](https://github.com/valentinmk/python-tarantool-benchmark-and-bootstrap/blob/master/install.md).
