# Python and Tarantool Benchmark and Bootstrap

This is demo solution for my article on [GitBook](https://valentinmk.gitbooks.io/python-tarantool-benchmark/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@valentinmk/python-and-tarantool-races-in-the-loop-f496b6467ea4).

The goal of the project was benchmark Tarantool and Python async web servers performance.

The second purpose was to show how you could write solution with Tarantool and aiohttp, sanic and japronto libraries.

You can install the project on your own server by reproducing bash commands described in [install.md](https://github.com/valentinmk/python-tarantool-benchmark-and-bootstrap/blob/master/install.md).
